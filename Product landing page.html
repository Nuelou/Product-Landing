                </P>
            <h3>ENGINEERING AND DESIGN</h3>
            <P>The activities of the 'Engineering and Design department comprises primarily the boosting and carrying out of new ideas and the execution of projects involving engineering, design, material specification, construction, and erection liaison activities. Professionals; Engineers, Designer and CAD/CAE Operators cover these aspects of Engineering and Construction activities from feasibility studies, economic assessment project management, completion of turnkey projects.
                We frequently use the word “design”, but what is design? It has been noted that:¬
                * Design is an activity that recognizes the goals or purposes of products or systems.
                * Design is an activity that shapes its objects - creates their forms - in accordance with the goals or purposes of those objects.
                * The product design process transforms abstract customer demand into specific product drawings. 
                * The product design process is a process of function allocation that identifies product   purposes.
                * The product design process manipulates information creatively and the product design process is a decision making process. It has been proposed that designing is defining.       It was portrayed for design being an evolution from a low dimensional abstract model          to higher dimensional concrete models.
                In order to design for competitive advantage we must design for the above attributes    and more. Note that the 'three elements of competitiveness' are: ¬
                * Timeliness: Can the product be delivered to our clients just in time that it is demanded? 
                * Quality: Will the product work well as intended? 
                * Affordability: Are our clients willing to pay for our services?
                These three dimensions largely determine the value of a product to our clients. To gain the competitive advantage we: ¬
                
                Design for value (choice)
                HANARAN SERVICES LIMITED follows these processes and guidelines in our design, using optimum and cost effective means to execute the design process. 
                The two primary dimensions of value are cost and quality, whereby other aspects are related to and are interface with the dynamic nature of doing business.
                Design for cost (cheaper)
                Which is a proactive and conscious solution of the cost minimization of the execution of projects? This will be done either in a quantitative or qualitative sense. The target costing is a practical and powerful optimization algorithm for reducing cost, which takes one or more steps in each design cycle. Design for quality (better)
                To be competitive, HANARAN SERVICES LIMITED aims at satisfying her Customers (our Company objective). In order to be more competitive, HANARAN SERVICES LIMITED tries to take delight in her Customers. To do so we design for quality.
                The design for quality is a quality driven form of integrated product, process and business development. We focus on developing our products and services, improving, maintaining and continually improving on the system to bring forth, sustain and retain our products and business Image.
                Design for cycle time (faster)
                From the cost perspective, ‘time is money'. Time is the competitive edge in the marketplace, and used as a third basic dimension of competitiveness. Cycle time is one of the many metrics highlighted by total quality control, which requires continual improvement.
                Other elements of the design from the perspective of competitive advantage, which are used in our engineering and design group, are conceptual design ability, availability, testability, operability, Supportability.
                </P>

            <h3>NIGERIAN CONTENT</h3>
            <p>It is our policy to use resources from Nigeria (both materials and personnel), if available and an acceptable level of quality can be guaranteed. Sourcing, acquisition and expending will be executed from Port Harcourt.
                Nigerian engineer will be part of the teams in order to gain experience and to express the typical Nigerian situation of the operation in Niger Delta inland waters.
                With the view to stimulating the economy of the (host) community and enriching the indigene, a reasonable percentage of the labour force will be recruited from the work area. The local labour will form an integral part of the workforce and will be accorded all rights and privileges due any other employee during the period of engagement.
                It is recognized that construction works of reasonable magnitude affect the immediate environment as well as the activities of the surrounding communities. Such impacts will include a tremendous increase in the volume of water traffic, especially boats and heavy duty and load carrying barges for haulage of materials, equipment and personnel to site. Other ways of impacting on the environment is due to site construction/camp activities and noise from construction equipment.
                In order to reduce cases of communities' disturbances, it has become expedient to put in place a clearly defined programme of action to address all community-related issues. The objectives of this programme are as follows:
                - To ensure a work programme devoid of interruption/disturbances arising from community or related issues.
                - To put in place a clearly defined method of resolving such issues as they arise.
                - To ensure that community derives maximum benefit from the work programme in   accordance with the overall HANARAN SERVICES LIMITED’s community related objectives.
                </p>
            <h3>COMMUNITY SUPPORT</h3>

                Our community affairs mission is to support the communities where we live and work by giving our time, talent and financial resources. We focus our philanthropy on community initiatives that are important to our stakeholders with particular emphasis on social and economic development. To maintain good relations with the local/host communities with which we come into contact during the course of our business. This includes observing the protocols and customs of the local communities, paying homage to community leaders and elders and engaging local labour as required. 
                We ensure that any labour employed does not compromise quality and HSE standards. Depending on merits, we also undertake community assistance projects to show its goodwill to host communities.
